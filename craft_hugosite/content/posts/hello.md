**Hello everyone,**

### Hello
Welcome to the special landing page for recruiters and creative people
interested in contacting me.

I am writing this to bring some information in regard of my current situation.
First of all, thank you for visiting my profile and being in contact with me.
I am always open for communication and glad to help.

### Not looking for a job for now
At the moment I am not looking for a job. However, as I mentioned I am always glad to be in communication and help people.

### Sorry for delay in response
Time to time I receive some number of messages and it takes time to write a short reply to everyone. Sometimes letters and incoming messages are just piling and it getting hard to process them. I am sorry about this, but it may take up to even month to concentrate and respond to everyone.

### Subscribe on any situation change
If you feel you want to be informed once something changed in regard of job-looking situation, just stay tuned.
For example, you can follow on my twitter account [https://twitter.com/nantipov_org](https://twitter.com/nantipov_org).\
Please find my all available communication channels on the left sidebar (`<--`).

### Languages
I speak English, Russian and a little bit of German. But honestly, I am far from high proficient in German. I learn German, but do not have so much opportunities to practice language on professional level. German messages are processed by _O(n<sup>3</sup>)_ time-complexity in my mind :-). I am working on this :-).


Thank you.\
Best regards,\
Nikolai Antipov
